I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy and Global Affairs at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Jue Wang](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00240). My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and public policy, particularly in the areas of technology acceptance, AI simulation for policy-making, and the ethical implications of generative AI. 
I am passionate about leveraging AI to address complex societal challenges and improve decision-making processes in governance and higher education.
