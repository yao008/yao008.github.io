I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy and Global Affairs at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and public policy, particularly in the areas of technology acceptance, AI simulation for policy-making, and the ethical implications of generative AI. 
I am passionate about leveraging AI to address complex societal challenges and improve decision-making processes in governance and higher education.
