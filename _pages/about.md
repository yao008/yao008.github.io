I am an assistant professor at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the University of Hong Kong (HKU), and the Principal Investigator (PI) of the **Network Intelligence and Computing Ecosystem (NICE) Lab**. The [NICE lab](https://hongyangdu.github.io/nice/) focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and computer networks, aiming to advance next-generation intelligent networks and distributed AI systems.
I obtained my Ph.D. degree at the College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Dusit Niyato](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/dniyato/). Prior to this, I obtained B.Eng. degree at Beijing Jiaotong University, China, under the guidance of Prof. [Jiayi Zhang](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8946/).

My research is primarily centered around the utilization of **Generative AI in Intelligent Networks**. Our key objective is to explore <font color=green>"how the intelligent networks can support various AI-Generated Content (AIGC) services"</font>, and <font color=green>"how generative AI can improve the intelligent network performance, security, and reliability"</font>. This involves exploring the integration of various networking methodologies:

1. AI for Network:
   - Generative artificial intelligence and network optimization
   - Reinforcement learning and its applications in computer networking systems
   - AI-enabled semantic communications
   - Human-centric AI for user-centric network design

2. Network for AI:
   - Distributed training and inference of large AI models
   - Next-generation wireless transmission technologies
   - Edge intelligence
