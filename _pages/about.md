I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy and Global Affairs at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Jue Wang](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00240). My research interests include Generative Artificial Intelligence in Education, Technology Adoption and Ethics, Education Policy, Innovation Governance, Knowledge Practices, and Academic Integrity. I am passionate about leveraging AI to address complex societal challenges and improve the decision-making process in governance and higher education.

## Ongoing Projects
- **To What Extent and How Do Scientific Structures and Practices Shape the Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence?**  
  - A large-scale international survey of 10,000 scholars to investigate the adoption and perception of generative AI across disciplines.  
- **Simulating Stakeholder Interactions in Policy Making Using Large Language Models**
  - Leverages LLMs to simulate stakeholder interactions in policy-making, addressing challenges like inclusivity and equity.
- **Authorship and Accountability in the Age of GenAI: Evidence from PhD Students**  
  - A survey experiment studying how PhD students assign credit and responsibility when using GenAI, and how competitive academic environments influence disclosure decisions.  
  - Lead and design the project
