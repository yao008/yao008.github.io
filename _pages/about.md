I am an assistant professor at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the University of Hong Kong (HKU). Before joining HKU, I received Ph.D. degree at the College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, supervised by Prof. Dusit Niyato. Prior to this, I received B.Eng. degree at Beijing Jiaotong University, China, supervised by Prof. Jiayi Zhang. I am now the Principal Investigator (PI) of the <b>Network Intelligence and <font color=green>C</font>omputing <font color=green>E</font>cosystem (NI<font color=green>CE</font>) Lab</b> @ HKU. The [NICE lab](https://hongyangdu.github.io/nice/) focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and computer networks, aiming to advance next-generation intelligent networks and distributed AI systems:



Our research is primarily centered around the utilization of **Generative AI in Intelligent Networks**. The key objective is to explore <font color=green>"how the intelligent networks can support various AI-Generated Content (AIGC) services"</font>, and <font color=green>"how generative AI can improve the intelligent network performance, security, and reliability"</font>. This involves exploring the integration of various networking methodologies:

1. AI for Network:
   - Generative artificial intelligence and network optimization
   - Reinforcement learning and its applications in computer networking systems
   - AI-enabled semantic communications
   - Human-centric AI for user-centric network design

2. Network for AI:
   - Distributed training and inference of large AI models
   - Next-generation wireless transmission technologies
   - Edge intelligence



>*I have multiple openings for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, visiting students, and interns. Please find [more details here](https://hongyangdu.github.io/nice/).*
