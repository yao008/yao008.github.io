## Research Aim

At the NICE Lab, we envision a future where AI and networks converge to create intelligent digital ecosystems. Our mission is to pioneer transformative technologies at this intersection, developing next-generation systems that are both technologically advanced and human-centric, ultimately building the foundation for a fully connected, intelligent world.

## Team Members


## My Support and Expectations

Our research is highly interdisciplinary, involving collaboration with experts from AI, networking systems, human–computer interaction, psychology, and electrical engineering. Our focus is primarily on publishing in top-tier AI conferences and IEEE journals, complemented by practical implementations. Our primary goal is to prepare our students for future academic positions as well as high-impact positions in industry. Here's what we're looking for and what you can expect from this journey:

### 1. What I Offer:
- Resources: Full scholarships covering study and living in Hong Kong, plus access to advanced research facilities.
- Guidance: **Hands-on mentorship with clear direction.** For outstanding students, I also offer adequate freedom and opportunities for growth.
- International Connections: Strong ties with leading researchers and institutions worldwide. I will help you build international academic connections.
- Friendly Environment and Work-Life Balance: Collaborative and supportive lab culture where teamwork and mutual respect are valued. **Say no to 996; embrace sustainable productivity.**

### 2. What I Expect from You:
- Passion for Learning: **Strong self-motivation and ability to quickly learn from new fields.**
- Academic Foundation: Academic background in computer science, AI, electrical engineering, electronic information/communication engineering, mathematics, or related fields. Candidates with bachelor's degrees from <i>985 / QS Top 50 universities</i> or <i>211 / QS Top 80 universities + strong publication records</i> are encouraged due to HKU committee considerations.
- Experience: Relevant research experience and coding ability demonstrated through papers, projects, or competitions.
- Personal Qualities: Responsibility, reliability, and good communication skills.
- Graduation Requirements: A PhD degree is just a ticket for your future career, so there is NO requirement for the NUMBER of papers. **Instead, the graduation requirement is for us to work together to help you find a satisfactory job, which marks the success of our collaborative journey.**
